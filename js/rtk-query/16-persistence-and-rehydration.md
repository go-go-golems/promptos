# RTK Query Persistence and Rehydration

Persistence refers to saving the state of your application so that it can be restored later, while rehydration is the process of reloading the persisted state back into the application. This is particularly useful in situations where you want to maintain the application's state across sessions or reloads.

## Understanding Rehydration with RTK Query
RTK Query, a powerful data fetching and caching tool, includes a feature for rehydrating state. The `extractRehydrationInfo` function is a key part of this process. It checks every action dispatched and uses the returned value to restore the state for successful or failed queries.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/' }),
  extractRehydrationInfo(action, { reducerPath }) {
    if (action.type === 'ACTION_TYPE') {
      return action.payload[reducerPath];
    }
  },
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    // endpoints here
  }),
});
```

## Best Practices for API Persistence
While persisting API slices can be useful, especially in native applications without browser cache, it's generally not recommended for web applications. Instead, using HTTP `Cache-Control` headers is advised to manage caching behavior and avoid serving stale data.

## Implementing Redux Persist with RTK Query
Redux Persist is a library that can be integrated with RTK Query to handle the persistence and rehydration of your application's state. The `REHYDRATE` action type from Redux Persist is used to trigger the rehydration process.

**Code Example: Root Reducer Rehydration**
```javascript
import { REHYDRATE } from 'redux-persist';

const api = createApi({
  // ...other settings
  extractRehydrationInfo(action, { reducerPath }) {
    if (action.type === REHYDRATE) {
      return action.payload[reducerPath];
    }
  },
  // ...endpoints
});
```

**Code Example: API Reducer Rehydration**
```javascript
import { REHYDRATE } from 'redux-persist';

const api = createApi({
  // ...other settings
  extractRehydrationInfo(action, { reducerPath }) {
    if (action.type === REHYDRATE && action.key === 'yourPersistKey') {
      return action.payload;
    }
  },
  // ...endpoints
});
```
