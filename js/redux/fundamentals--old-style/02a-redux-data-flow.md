### Detailed Data Flow in Redux with Code Examples

The data flow in Redux follows a strict unidirectional pattern, ensuring a consistent and predictable state management process. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how data flows through a Redux application:

1. **Initial Setup:**
    - A Redux store is created using a root reducer function.
    - The store initializes its state by calling the reducer with an `undefined` state and a special action, resulting in the reducer returning the initial state.

**Example: Creating and Initializing a Store**
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer,
  visibilityFilter: visibilityFilterReducer
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

2. **UI Rendering:**
    - UI components render based on the current state of the Redux store. Components can read data from the store using selectors.

**Example: Reading State in a UI Component**
```javascript
const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = useSelector(selectTodos); // Using a selector to read data
  // Render logic for the component using the todos data
};
```

3. **User Interaction:**
    - When a user interacts with the application (e.g., clicking a button), an action is dispatched to the store to signal that something has happened.

**Example: Dispatching an Action on User Interaction**
```javascript
const onAddTodo = todo => {
  store.dispatch({ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: todo });
};
```

4. **State Updates:**
    - The store runs the reducer function with the previous state and the dispatched action. The reducer computes a new state based on the action and returns it.

**Example: Reducer Handling an Action**
```javascript
function todosReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

5. **Store Updates:**
    - The Redux store saves the new state returned by the reducer. This is the only place where state updates happen.

**Example: Store Saving New State**
```javascript
// This happens internally in the Redux store
// after an action is dispatched and the reducer returns the new state.
```

6. **UI Updates:**
    - The store notifies all subscribed components that the state has changed. Subscribed components can re-render with the new state if necessary.

**Example: Subscribing to Store Updates**
```javascript
store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log('The state has changed:', store.getState());
});
```

7. **Re-rendering:**
    - Components that are connected to the Redux store will automatically re-render with the new state if they use the `useSelector` hook or the `connect` function from `react-redux`.

**Example: Component Re-rendering with New State**
```javascript
const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = useSelector(selectTodos); // Automatically re-renders when state changes
  // Render logic for the component using the updated todos data
};
```
