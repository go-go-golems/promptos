# Customizing Struct Field and Table Names with SQLC in Go

## Overview
Customize struct field and table names generated by SQLC using the `rename` mapping.

## Renaming Struct Fields

- SQLC generates struct field names by splitting column names on underscores and capitalizing each part.
- Customize names using the `rename` mapping in the SQLC configuration file.
- Keys are column names, values are the desired struct field names.

```yaml
version: "2"
sql:
- schema: "sqlite/schema.sql"
  queries: "sqlite/query.sql"
  engine: "sqlite"
  gen:
    go: 
      package: "authors"
      out: "sqlite"
      rename:
        spotify_url: "SpotifyURL"
```

## Renaming Table Structs

- SQLC generates struct names as singular versions of table names.
- Customize names using the `rename` mapping in the SQLC configuration file.
- Keys are generated struct names, values are the desired struct names.

```yaml
version: '1'
packages:
- path: db
  engine: sqlite
  schema: query.sql
  queries: query.sql
rename:
  author: Writer
```

## Limitations

- Rename mappings apply to an entire package.
- A column and a table with the same name can't be renamed to different values.
