To use SQLC Golang package for count commands:

1. Count all rows: 
```go
count, err := db.CountRows(ctx)
```
2. Count rows by group:
```go
rows, err := db.CountRowsByGroup(ctx)
for _, row := range rows { 
    fmt.Println(row.Column, row.Count) 
}
```
These functions are generated by SQLC based on SQL queries like `SELECT count(*) FROM table_name` and `SELECT column, count(*) FROM table_name GROUP BY column ORDER BY column` respectively.
