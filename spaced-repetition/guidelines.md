# Spaced repetition and effective prompts - overview

• Spaced repetition systems are powerful tools for learning, but their effectiveness depends on the quality of the prompts.
• Retrieval practice is the key mechanism behind effective spaced repetition learning.
• Different types of knowledge (factual, procedural, conceptual) require different approaches to prompt-writing.
• Good prompts should be focused, precise, consistent, tractable, and effortful.
• Prompts should be written and revised iteratively over time.
• The emotional connection to review sessions and content is crucial for effective practice.
• Techniques like elaborative encoding, salience prompts, and open lists can enhance the effectiveness of prompts.
• It's important to connect new knowledge to personal experiences and existing understanding.

## General guidelines for good flash cards

Here's a general list of guidelines that can be applied when creating flash cards.

1. Focus on retrieval: Ensure prompts require active recall of information from memory.
2. Keep prompts focused: Target one specific detail or concept per prompt.
3. Be precise: Write clear, unambiguous questions that have consistent answers.
4. Ensure tractability: Make prompts challenging but not impossibly difficult to answer.
5. Make prompts effortful: Avoid questions that can be answered through simple pattern matching or inference.
6. Break down complex knowledge: Decompose information into discrete components for more efficient learning.
7. Use cues and elaborative encoding: Add relevant context or associations to help reinforce memory.
8. Adapt to knowledge types: Use appropriate strategies for factual, procedural, and conceptual knowledge.
9. Create open lists for expandable concepts: Use techniques like example generation for topics that grow over time.
10. Employ salience prompts: Keep important ideas top-of-mind by asking how they apply to your life or work.
11. Write prompts iteratively: Start with a few key prompts and add more as you deepen your understanding.
12. Revise prompts over time: Flag and improve prompts that consistently cause difficulty or feel unclear.
13. Avoid binary questions: Rephrase yes/no questions as more open-ended prompts to encourage deeper understanding.
14. Provide sufficient context: Ensure questions have enough information to avoid ambiguity or multiple correct answers.
15. Connect to personal meaning: Write prompts that relate the information to your own experiences or goals.
16. Use creative prompts: Encourage application of knowledge with prompts that ask for novel examples or solutions.
17. Prioritize emotional connection: Focus on writing prompts for information that genuinely matters to you.
18. Balance detail and big picture: Write prompts that cover both specific facts and broader concepts or relationships.
19. Use images and mnemonics: Incorporate visual elements or memory techniques when helpful.
20. Regularly evaluate prompt usefulness: Delete or revise prompts that no longer feel relevant or valuable.

## Steps to prepare the material

a. Initial read-through: Comprehensively read the entire text.
b. Identify key information: Highlight important facts, concepts, and ideas.
c. Categorize knowledge types: Separate information into factual, procedural, and conceptual knowledge.
d. Prioritize content: Determine which information is most critical or valuable to learn.
e. Break down complex ideas: Decompose larger concepts into smaller, discrete components.
f. Identify relationships and connections: Look for cause-and-effect relationships, comparisons, and contrasts.
g. Formulate potential questions: Brainstorm possible questions for each key piece of information.
h. Determine appropriate prompt types: Decide which prompt types would be most effective for each piece of information.
i. Add context and cues: Consider necessary context and possible mnemonics for each potential prompt.
j. Create a structured outline: Organize the identified information, questions, and prompt ideas logically.
k. Draft explanations and elaborations: Write out clear, concise explanations for complex topics.
l. Identify potential images or diagrams: Note any visual elements that could enhance understanding or recall.
m. Prepare a revision strategy: Plan how to revisit and potentially revise the prompts over time.
n. Create an intermediate document: Compile all the above information into a structured document.
o. Review and refine: Ensure all key information is captured and look for ways to improve prompts.
